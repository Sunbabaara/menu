                    <p>The nutrition information on this website is derived from testing conducted 
                        in accredited laboratories, published resources, or from information provided 
                        from McDonald's suppliers. The nutrition information is based on standard product 
                        formulations and serving sizes.  Calories for fountain beverages are based on standard 
                        fill levels plus ice. If you use the self-service fountain inside the restaurant for 
                        your drink order, see the sign posted at the beverage fountain for beverage calories 
                        without ice. All nutrition information is based on average values for ingredients and 
                        is rounded in accordance with current U.S. FDA NLEA regulations. Variation in serving 
                        sizes, preparation techniques, product testing and sources of supply, as well as regional 
                        and seasonal differences may affect the nutrition values for each product. In addition, 
                        product formulations change periodically. You should expect some variation in the nutrient 
                        content of the products purchased in our restaurants. Beverage sizes may vary in your market.
