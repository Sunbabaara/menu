                    <h2>FOOD</h2>
                    <p>Food, substance consisting essentially of protein, carbohydrate, fat, 
                        and other nutrients used in the body of an organism to sustain growth and 
                        vital processes and to furnish energy. The absorption and utilization of food 
                        by the body is fundamental to nutrition and is facilitated by digestion. Plants,
                         which convert solar energy to food by photosynthesis, are the primary food source.
                         Animals that feed on plants often serve as sources of food for other animals.
